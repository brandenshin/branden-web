<P>Today we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the World Wide Web Consortium. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, our Director and the inventor of the World Wide Web, founded the Web Consortium on this day, 1 October, in 1994 to ensure the long-term growth of the Web.
Since then, with the help of our Members and our community, we have been proud to work to create a Web that is accessible to all, whatever the hardware, software, network infrastructure, native language, culture, geographical location, or physical or mental ability; a Web which is good for all.</p>
